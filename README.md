# BSP-fjrp-developmental
this is the test version of the bsp fjrp bot  
it is coded in the javascript discord.js library  
only really the source code for the bot is available here, if you want to set up an actual bot or "borrow" the bsp bot (status of bsp bot yet unknown) youll have to ask someone  
to set up the project on your computer you have to first install node.js by downloading it off the nodejs website then using the command `npm init` and filling in the project details in the folder you want to store the files in  
node js and discord.js are required to run the code, the first of which can be installed off the node.js website as described before, and the second of which should be installed in the folder youre storing all the code in using the command `npm install discord.js` once you've installed node 
the token doesnt come with the code, i suggest someone asking aadie to create a communal bsp bot and getting a token from that  
you can change the token and command prefix in config.js  
run the bot using node with the command `node index.js` (opens index.js with node)
have fun

# BSP-fjrp-developmental
this is the test version of the bsp fjrp bot  
it is coded in the javascript discord.js library  
only really the source code for the bot is available here, you can't run a bot with this alone, you need to set up a bot on the discord developer website or borrow the BSP communal bot, token in #server-announcements.  

to set up the project on your computer you have to first install node.js by downloading it off the nodejs website then using the command `npm init` and filling in the project details in the folder you want to store the files in  
node js and discord.js are required to run the code, the first of which can be installed off the node.js website as described before, and the second of which should be installed in the folder youre storing all the code in using the command `npm install discord.js` once you've installed node 

you can change the token and command prefix in config.js  
run the bot using node with the command `node index.js` (opens index.js with node)
have fun

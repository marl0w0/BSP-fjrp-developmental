# BSP-fjrp-developmental
this is the test version of the bsp fjrp bot  
it is coded in the javascript discord.js library  
node js and discord.js are required to run the code, the first of which can be installed off the node.js website, and the second of which should be installed in the same directory as all the files you download here with the command `npm install discord.js` once you've installed node  
you DO need your own token to run this bot, i suggest someone asking aadie to create a communal bsp bot and getting a token from that  
you can change the token and command prefix in config.js  
have fun
